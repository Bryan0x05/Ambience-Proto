# Ambience

Cross-platform Wallpaper Manager that changes your device's wallpaper by the following criteria (and any combination between these):

- Time of day
- Weekday
- Month
- Weather Conditions  

Our project will focus on Windows devices for now. We decided to scrap the idea of MacOS because not all of us have access to an Apple computer, and it would be unfair for those who do not. There would be issues whenever we're testing code.

# Roadmap

This should be updated bit by bit as we figure out the "whats" and the "hows" of our project.


# Tools Used

Again, this should also be updated as we go with the packages that we use.

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/): Google's cross-platform SDK for multiple platforms with a single codebase
  - [Requests](https://pub.dev/packages/requests): Flutter package to simplify HTTP/HTTPS requests
