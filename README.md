# Ambience

Cross-platform Wallpaper Manager that changes your device's wallpaper by the following criteria (and any combination between these):

- Time of day
- Weekday
- Month
- Weather Conditions  

# Roadmap

This should be updated bit by bit as we figure out the "whats" and the "hows" of our project.


# Tools Used

Again, this should also be updated as we go with the packages that we use.

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/): Google's cross-platform SDK for multiple platforms with a single codebase
  - [Requests](https://pub.dev/packages/requests): Flutter package to simplify HTTP/HTTPS requests
